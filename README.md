# medical-expenses-prediction
"medical-expenses-prediction" repo: Analyze &amp; predict medical costs using ML. Leverage historical data to build models estimating future expenses. Valuable resource for healthcare pros &amp; researchers. Code, datasets, analysis tools provided.

# Introduction

The "medical-expenses-prediction" project aims to analyze and predict medical costs using machine learning techniques, providing valuable insights for healthcare professionals and researchers.


# Data

The data directory contains the dataset named medical_expenses.csv, which holds information about individuals' medical expenses and related attributes. It includes columns like age, sex, BMI, number of children, smoker status, region, and medical charges. This dataset is used to train and test the prediction models in the project.

# Models


This repository contains code implementations of three regression models for predicting medical expenses:

-**Linear Regression:** This model uses a straight line to estimate medical expenses based on input attributes.

-**Random Forest Regressor:** By combining multiple decision trees, this model can handle complex datasets and capture non-linear relationships.

-**Gradient Boosting Regressor:** This algorithm sequentially builds an ensemble of weak prediction models, improving accuracy by focusing on instances with larger errors.

# Conclusion

In conclusion, when we run the model scripts, we will see the results displayed on the console. We can compare the performance of different models and assess their predictive capabilities using metrics like mean absolute error (MAE), mean squared error (MSE), and R-squared score. These metrics provide valuable insights into how well the models are able to predict medical expenses.
